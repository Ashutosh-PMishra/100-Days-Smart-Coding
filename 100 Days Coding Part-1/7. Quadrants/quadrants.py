# Write a Python program to find the Quadrants in which coordinates lie

# Description â†’ 
#  Get the value of x and y coordinates as input from the user and check in which quadrant the point lies and print it.

# If both numbers are positive then, it displays the first quadrant.
# Example: Input = 5, 4
# Output = 1st quadrant

# If the first number is negative and the second number is positive then, it displays the second quadrant.
# Example: Input = -5, 4
# Output= 2nd quadrant

# If the first number is negative and the second number is also negative then, it displays the third quadrant.
# Example: Input = -5,-4
# Output= 3rd quadrant

# If the first number is positive and the second number is negative then, it displays the fourth quadrant.
# Example: Input = 5,-4
# Output = 4th quadrant


# Input
# 10 20
# Output
# This point lies in first quadrant.

# Input
# -10 20
# Output
# This point lies in second quadrant.
